        Asking students to strive for 3 things to bring humanity back into art seems like a noble goal. 1. To Show that the art CAME rom someone. 2. To make the art FOR someone. 3. To show tha the art BELONGS in a particular context. 
        <br/>
        As a student hearing this from a professor, I would feel inspired to create something that is innately human. To prove that there is humanity in it. 
        As discussed in the article the feeling that art has been composed rather than created, to me seems as though art has been predicted.
        AI models are trained on large existing sets of data, some could argue that makes AI human as it is a cumulative summary of many other human responses. 
        AI is trained to predict, it is not trained to understand the feeling of loneliness, the feeling of loss or of immense peacefulness, at least not yet. 
        This raises the question of whether art created by AI can ever truly be considered human or if it will always lack the depth of genuine human experience.

        I really enjoyed relating the beauty of the process of creating to training for a race and triathlon. Both require dedication, practice, and a deep understanding of oneself. Just as athletes must push through physical and mental barriers to achieve their goals, artists must also confront their own limitations and vulnerabilities in order to create meaningful work.
