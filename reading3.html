        I have always been part Cyborg. I had my first fitbit in 7th grade, my first iphone in 6th, and my first apply watch in 9th grade. 
    </p>This mindset of thinking about wearables in the definition of a cyborg is interesting. It raises questions about the nature of humanity and our relationship with technology.
    But also highlights how often humans wear technology to enhance our lives without fully thinking about how connected that makes us to the internet. I still currently wear a fitness device on my wrist everyday, however I have opted for a Whoop - which noticeably does not have a screen. 
    After being part Cyborg for so long, I am looking for ways to distance myself from screens.

    This concept of 'rooms' as is discused in the article is also fascinating. The idea that our physical spaces are intertwined with our digital experiences is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. As I try to create a more balanced relationship with technology, I am also considering how my environment influences my interactions with it.
    While virtual reality offers an experience like the rooms described, I realize I never have experienced this concept of a room before.
    It is interesting me that I have been part Cyborg for so long, a term that feels alien, and yet have never considered the room experience before, somthing that should feel much more human.
