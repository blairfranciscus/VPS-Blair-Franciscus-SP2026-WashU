        1/14/2026: Thoughts on Resturant Websites Interview
        <br>
        <br>
        Reading this interview about restaurant websites was incredibly interesting to think about, as so much has changed over the last 7 years!
        From 2019 to 2026 - menus have had to go from mostly on paper to almost all online with QR code menus.
        Additionally, food social media websites have gotten pretty popular, like the app Beli. 
        I enjoyed the thought provoking process of why a restaurant would need a website in the first place? Is this a place to show the websites personality?
        Or is it simply a means to an end for a Wednesday night food exploration for a couple in St. Louis?
        I think of myself as a mostly practical person and have only visited restaurant websites in the past to order food, peak at the menu, or to find a reservation. 
        I have never thought about wanting to share a restaurant's ambiance in the website before. I love the idea of letting patrons
        peak inside the restaurant digitally by giving them a preview on the website of what to expect when they come to enjoy their meal there.
        Overall, I enjoyed the process of analyzing why restaurants have websites as it's something I've never given much thought before.
