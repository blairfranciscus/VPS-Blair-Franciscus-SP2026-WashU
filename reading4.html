Websites as a Shifting House 2/4/2026

Intentionality in the online world is a dying value. With easily accessible ways to share your opinions, like Twitter and TikTok, the focus has shifted from meaningful discourse to quick, attention-grabbing content. This shift has profound implications for how we communicate and engage with information online.
When I think about what I want to 'Put out' into the world, I think about the intentionality behind an entire website that represents me. It requires more than a quick thought typed up and put onto a social forum. There are many choices one has to make that can digitally convey their identity, passion, mission, and why.

When thinking about my personal website, whether it's a shelf, rock, garden or puddle. I question if I am truly representing myself in the way I want to be seen.
Maybe I want to be seen as a rock, solid and unchanging. Or perhaps a garden, constantly growing and evolving. Each choice reflects a different aspect of my identity and how I wish to engage with the world.
Or is this more about my process, how sometimes I have enough to fill a lake with my online presence, while other times I feel like a mere puddle, barely making a splash?
