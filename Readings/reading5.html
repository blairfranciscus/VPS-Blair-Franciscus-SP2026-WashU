Eno Documentary response
<br/>

Watching Eno made me think a lot about how art—especially music—functions as a way to connect people rather than just something to consume individually. The documentary shows music as a social tool, shaped by intention and design, and it was interesting to learn why humans are so drawn to it in the first place. 
Eno’s idea of “designing conditions for perception” reframed creativity for me: instead of creating a fixed, static object, he focuses on building systems that can evolve over time. 
That feels especially challenging in a screen-based medium, where images often feel locked to a single moment. The film suggests that intentional constraints are what allow something to remain nonstatic and continuously meaningful. 
This made me reflect on the idea raised in the documentary that our brains may be getting smaller rather than larger, and whether technological advancement actually makes us better equipped to connect with society—or if art and music are what still create the most meaningful shared experiences.
